        Hi! I'm Chemsoft. This is my design portfolio where I share all of my favorite work. When I'm not designing things, I enjoy reading and learn how things work. I'm a software engineer with experience. 
        I've tutor many people how to code and how to become professional software engineers 
        through my online courses and my YouTube channel will be ready soonest.
I am going to teach you how to think like a programmer.
Enrol with us and become a web or mobile developer.

<p align="right">No prior knowledge needed.</p>
        I believe coding should be fun and accessible to everyone.
      If you'd like to follow me on Twitter, my username is @Chemsoft1.
